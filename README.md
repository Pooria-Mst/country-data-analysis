Data description and problem statement:
The dataset contains information about countries, including various socio-economic and health indicators. Below is the description of the dataset columns:

Dataset Description country: Name of the country. child_mort: Child mortality rate (deaths per 1000 children under 5 years). exports: Exports as a percentage of GDP. health: Health expenditure as a percentage of GDP. imports: Imports as a percentage of GDP. income: Net income per person. inflation: Inflation rate (annual %). life_expec: Life expectancy at birth (years). total_fer: Total fertility rate (children per woman). gdpp: GDP per capita.

The objective of this dataset is to determine how to distribute a fixed amount of funding among countries. To ensure a fair and effective allocation, we analyzed the data and created clusters to identify which countries require more assistance. Since the dataset lacks a target variable, we applied unsupervised learning methods, both before and after applying PCA, to achieve the best results.
